!!!warning  
    Carelink server are subject to frequent modifications that might break the feature.  
    Consider using [Companion app](../companion) on the master phone and xDrip+ [Sync](../xdripfollower) or Nightscout to share data.  
    The CarePartner app authentication is valid for 1 week, thus even if xDrip+ is unable to connect to CareLink for a few days (for example due to the lack of internet connection), it will be able to renew the login (refresh the token) automatically in the background after it can connect to CareLink again without needing to login again manually using the browser. The user account restriction applies to this authentication process as well:   
    **a dedicated follower account must be used for xDrip+, you cannot use the same follower for other apps or phones.**
