xDrip+ provides an easy way to copy settings from one phone to another.

### Show Settings QR Code

Show settings QR code displays a QR code containing xDrip+ settings.

!!!xdrip "`Show Settings QR Code`"  
    <img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />  
    &ensp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_qrcode_grey600_48dp.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Show settings QR code

!!!xdripitem "Share Settings via QR code"  
    &ensp;Use QR codes to transfer settings->Auto configure feature

xDrip+ security key is used for xDrip+ Sync, if you only want to share a a follower code (that is difficult to copy manually) use this.

!!!xdripitem "**`XDRIP PLUS SECURITY KEY SETTINGS ONLY`**"

General and collection settings include general settings and your hardware data source settings.

!!!xdripitem "**`SHOW GENERAL AND COLLECTION SETTINGS`**"

All settings include all (not alarms: you need to recreate them manually).

!!!xdripitem "**`COPY ALL SETTINGS`**"

You will obtain a QR code that you can scan with Auto Configure on another phone.

### Auto Configure

Auto configure allows you to import settings from a QR code.

!!!xdrip "`Auto Configure`"  
    <img src="../../images/hamburger_menu.png" style="zoom:75%;" />  
    &ensp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/master/app/src/main/res/drawable-xhdpi/ic_qrscan.png" style="width:5%;" />&ensp;Auto Configure

You need to authorize xDrip+ to access the phone camera.

You can then scan the QR code displayed on another phone in order to copy the settings you selected when displaying it as explained [above](#show-settings-qr-code).

Current settings will be overwritten.

You might need to restart your phone to apply the changes.
