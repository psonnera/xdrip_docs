As for xDrip+ sync you can define which phone will actually send the motion information: it will be the motion master, only one device can be master. You can setup a device to be follower to motion in order to monitor remotely the master device motion.

!!!xdripitem "Use remote motion"  
    &ensp;Motion data taken from remote rather than local handset source

!!!xdripitem "Act as motion master"  
    &ensp;Be the master for motion data even if we are a follower. Set this on only one handset!

Vehicle mode enables more options.

!!!xdripitem "Enable vehicle mode"  
    &ensp;When vehicle is detected enable extra features
