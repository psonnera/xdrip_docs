    &ensp;Smart Watch Features  
    &emsp;  Pebble integration

After you've paired your Pebble with your phone, you can enable it in xDrip+.  
With recent Android versions, using this legacy watch is [challenging](https://www.reddit.com/r/pebble/comments/1776bbx/installing_pebble_apk_on_fresh_android_14_setup/). Use [Rebble](https://rebble.io/) resources.

!!!xdripitem "Pebble watch integration&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; â†’`ON`" 

xDrip+ will then install itself the watchface (no need to download it).

It will also propose you to install the snooze button app, if you skipped it you can do it later with Install Pebble Apps at the bottom.

You can select different watchfaces.
